A simple note taking app made with Django. http://toki1.pythonanywhere.com/
##### 

Toki is a simple note taking Django project. It was developed to act as a Hands-on and to increase my experience with a MVC framework(MTV as in the case of Django).

##### 

I was interested in Django from the first time I searched about and after a little investigation I choose Django as the base for this project.
